# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This project is simple React weather application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to get the weather data for a given city.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `src` - Contains the source code for the application
  - `components` - Contains the React components for the application
  - `hooks` - Contains the custom hooks for the application
  - `store` - Contains the Redux store for the application
  - `App.css` - Contains the CSS for the application
  - `App.js` - Contains the main React component for the application
  - `index.css` - Contains the CSS for the application
  - `index.js` - Contains the entry point for the application

## Project Dependencies

The project uses the following dependencies:

- `@reduxjs/toolkit` - Redux toolkit for state management
- `axios` - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- `react-redux` - Official React bindings for Redux
- `redux` - A predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- `redux-thunk` - Thunk middleware for Redux
- `react-router-dom` - DOM bindings for React Router
- `react-select` - A flexible and beautiful Select Input control for ReactJS with multiselect, autocomplete, async and creatable support
- `react-alert` - A simple and very customizable alert component for React
- `dotenv` - Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`
- `tailwindcss` - A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
